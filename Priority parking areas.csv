Lockharton,"Priority Parking","The formal consultation on Priority Parking proposals in Lockharton revealed that the majority of residents who responded supported the introduction of parking controls. 
The results of the formal consultation were reported to the Transport and Environment Committee on 3 June 2014. They indicated that 28 residents support the proposals, 14 objected and four offered general comments. It was recommended to introduce Priority Parking in Lockharton where there is clear support for the proposals. 
The main aim of Priority Parking is to help residents park closer to their homes without moving problems elsewhere. It involves part-time residentsâ€™ parking places that only operate for a short period each day while other areas of kerbside space will remain uncontrolled.

Murrayfield,"Priority Parking","An informal consultation with Murrayfield residents in 2013 indicated that people had problems parking near their homes and many supported the introduction of a Priority Parking scheme.
The results showed that; 135 residents supported the proposals, 122 opposed them and six people offered general comments. Further analysis found that greater support lies to the southern part of the area, in the streets closer to Glasgow Road. 
On that basis, the proposals moved to the formal consultation stage which started on 6 June and runs until 27 June 2014. The aim of the consultation is to find out if there is support for the scheme and to seek any objections to it. A letter was delivered to each property within the area with further information on how to participate in the consultation.

"Nether Liberton","Priority Parking","The results of the formal consultation on Priority Parking proposals were reported to the Transport and Environment Committee on 3 June 2014. 
The results indicated that the majority of residents who responded to the consultation supported the introduction of the scheme. There were 47 residents who supported the proposals, 21 objections and 10 people offered general comments. However, there was a very low response rate, around 9%, so Committee decided to approve the scheme on the condition that the local Councillors also approved. The ward members approved the introduction of the scheme and work has begun to ensure a September or October 2014 start.

Priestfield,"Priority Parking","The results of the formal consultation on the introduction of Priority Parking in the Priestfield area were reported to the Transport and Environment Committee on 3 June 2014. 
There was clear support for the introduction of Priority Parking with 103 residents in support, 19 objections and 10 people offering general comments. 
On this basis, Committee approved the introduction of the scheme and work is under way to ensure a September or October 2014 start.

"Telford Road","Priority Parking","A number of residents suggested that they had problems parking in their street and that a Priority Parking scheme could help them park closer to their homes.
An informal consultation was conducted to ask residents whether they considered such a scheme was necessary or not. The results indicated that 29 residents supported the proposals, while 26 opposed them and three offered general comments. 
Following discussions with local Councillors it was suggested that there is more support for Priority Parking than the consultation revealed. The Community Council organised a public meeting on 31 March 2014 where many residents attended to discuss parking in their area. 
On that basis a further consultation was conducted between 9 to 27 June 2014. A letter was delivered to each household in the area with details on how to tell the Council your views. The results of this consultation are expected to be reported to the August 2014 meeting of the Transport and Environment Committee. 
You can find a copy of that letter, plus a map of the area concerned and an information sheet on how Priority parking would work below.
